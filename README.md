# Introduction.

In this article,  We are going to make a Mini USB Led Lamp. this is kind of a night lamp. and this led lamp is very small in size and very useful.
I have made this Mini USB Led Lamp using the JLCPCB  SMT assembly Services.
I have also designed the case and diffuser for this led lamp, By using diffuser we got even diffused warm light.
We can use this USB Led lamp for various purpose.
Like We can use as...

1.Night bulb.
2.Warm light for rooms.
3.Emergency lights for trips.

This led lamp produces dim warm light which is eye soothing.
Size of this USB Led lamp is so small ,  that  we can easily carry inside our pocket.
This lamp has USB-A Connector. And through this USB connector we can connect to any travel adapter, most of adaptor comes with USB-A interface.
Just connect this USB  Led lamp to adapter and plugin the adapter to electrical board.
And your night bulb is ready.
So to power-up this lamp we only required an adapter and nowadays everyone has these adapters in their houses.
And apart from this adapter we can also give power Supply from the power banks, Power banks also has USB-A interface.
